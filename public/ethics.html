  <div class="ethics-grid">
    <div class="ethics-card">
      <img src="subjective realtivism.jpeg" alt="Subjective Relativism">
      <h3>1. Subjective Relativism</h3>
      <p>Each person has right to exercise and it depends on his will whether he/she wants to exercise.Same goes for KEVIN (chacha) if he wants to exercise or not .The APP will help our community, get fit, track exercise, make new friends </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ethics-card">
      <img src="cultural realtivism.jpeg" alt="Cultural Relativism">
      <h3>2. Cultural Relativism</h3>
      <p>The society decides for our health and we need to exercise or not depends on the cultural society , so do society decides for KEVIN (chacha) if he should exercise or not. It’s an APP that improves UFV’s image, and may sell our university more in the community:
 </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ethics-card">
      <img src="divine.jpeg" alt="Divine Command">
      <h3>3. Divine Command Theory</h3>
      <p>This app promotes kindness and respect through wellness and self-care. The God decides whether you need to exercise or not , so do for KEVIN (Chacha) the God will decide whether he needs to exercise or not but no Kevin will exercise under the will of god </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ethics-card">
      <img src="ethical.jpeg" alt="Ethical Egoism">
      <h3>4. Ethical Egoism</h3>
      <p>It works in a way that it's the self-interest of the users . It depends upon the self interest of KEVIN (Chacha) like what he gains in return of doing exercise.UFV will be a leader in this field, nothing like this exists – would could then include other universities/colleges</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ethics-card">
      <img src="kant.png" alt="Kantianism">
      <h3>5. Kantianism</h3>
      <p>KEVIN ought to do execrise as this might bring profits either way moneywise and healthwise thus we act ethically because we ought to — protecting data, promoting honesty, and treating users as ends.We’re so lucky to live in Canada</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ethics-card">
      <img src="act.jpeg" alt="Utilitarianism">
      <h3>6. Act Utilitarianism</h3>
      <p>KEVIN (chacha) should only workout if doing exercise gives him happiness. Each workout or friendship formed increases total happiness in our community.Thus is produces happiness for chacha also </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ethics-card">
      <img src="rule.jpeg" alt="Rule Utilitarianism">
      <h3>7. Rule Utilitarianism</h3>
      <p>Now for Chacha the units of happiness is definetly money but while exercising it would be calories burned by Kevin . By following fair fitness and data practices, it ensures the greatest good for the greatest number.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ethics-card">
      <img src="social.jpeg" alt="Social Contract">
      <h3>8. Social Contract & Rawls theory of justice</h3>
      <p>Kevin should share his wealth as he is very rich so that he can help the less rich people .Therfore the app operates with transparency, fairness, and opportunity for all — profits reinvested into UFV students.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ethics-card">
      <img src="virtue.jpeg" alt="Virtue Ethics">
      <h3>9. Virtue Ethics</h3>
      <p>Our App works with core values like  honesty, courage, balance, and community well-being over profit.</p>
